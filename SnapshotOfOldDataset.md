|4096|>c# fud ransomware;>c#;>stub size: 250kb (lol);no. using a high level language for writing malware is a huge red flag. and the rest of their specs confirms it, there is nothing revolutionary there. i can't recommend any specific product but if you want bleeding edge stuff you need to go to russian language forums.;;edit: if you want to write your own ultimate ransomware learn (preferably in order):;;;general programming (start with python 3+ if you never programmed before, there are shit ton of tutorials and it's easy to learn);;c/c++;;x86-64 asm;;operating system design;;windows internals;;reverse engineering;;computer forensics;;cryptography engineering;;software design;;secure coding;;powershell (optional);if you want something just good enough, you can skip some of them. but you won't make a dent, you will only make some white hat newbie happy by providing him with an easily reversible stub. and maybe couple of thousand bucks because you are lucky.|FALSE|3/6/2019 16:17:00|/d/hacking|
|4097|but if i would target some random users, not high profile servers, then does it really matter if someone will be able to create decrypter?;using better language would be useful for some serious encrypting of very valuable data, not some .jpgs and .txts of random windows user;so is c# enough for this?|FALSE|4/6/2019 0:45:00|/d/hacking|
|4098|the problem is then you have to select your targets very carefully. if you are just scanning random ips hoping for a n-day exploit or easily crackable ssh/telnet ports it is most likely that you are going to hit a honeypot instead of a real target. this is how av companies find, reverse engineer and fingerprint malware and also most security researchers run honeypots hoping to catch yet another stuxnet so they can write a shiny blog post about it and become famous and get all the business opportunities coming their way. and once you are fingerprinted you are fucked without a proper crypter. and the random crypter you found in the public most likely will backdoor your stub without you being ever aware of it.;;here is an example of what happens when you are careless and pick shortcuts instead of time proven proper ways:;hxxp://archivecaslytosk.onion/4jizr|FALSE|4/6/2019 1:00:00|/d/hacking|

|4129|i was looking into getting a hacktown membership. i just want to do my due diligence and make sure it is not a scam.;;dose the membership include the keyloggers and rat software or are those extra once you join?;also i am hesitant about downloading stuff like that on my pc how do i know that there isnt malware in it and they wont steal all my info or ransomware my ass;;if you are a member can you share your experience with  hacktown;;;thank you in advance for your replies|TRUE|4/8/2021 7:09:00|/d/hacking|

|4138|hacktown is not a scam. it's my retirement project to keep my idle hands busy :);;it's a place i created for people to learn from my experience when i was operating as a cybercriminal so others can re-create what i did and profit just like i did. it's not a hacking course per se but will teach you specific cybercriminal skills to apply in the real world which include some hacking skills and online fraud.;;people will tell you that you can learn this knowledge anywhere. this is not as easy as it seems and you'll spend an absurd amount of time trying to do so. people will tell you just phish their credentials, infect them with malware, etc. but no one will tell you step by step to pull it all off. this is where you'll learn everything and be able to apply it in the real world.;;membership only includes access to hacktown (courses and forum) but the membership fees are used towards testing new malware so people can purhcase specific malware (ransomware, rat, etc.) with confidence, cc resources, server costs, reimbursing members if they run into trouble, and many other perks.;;i've heard so many success stories of others profiting and getting their cybercriminal operations off the floor which brings me joy which was my whole goal of creating it. random i know but true.;;if you enjoyed the free content you'll enjoy what hacktown has to offer.|FALSE|7/8/2021 8:48:00|/d/hacking|
